--- if else condition construct is -
        if(condition){
            if block;
        }
        else if(condition){
            else if block;
        }
        else{
            else block;
        }

--- Any value that is not false, undefined, null, 0, NaN, or an empty string ('') 
    actually returns true when tested as a conditional statement, therefore you can 
    use a variable name on its own to test whether it is true, or even that it exists 
    (that is, it is not undefined.) 

--- To avoid nested if else conditions, logical AND (&&) and
    logical OR (||) is used.
    The last type of logical operator, NOT, expressed by the ! operator, can be used 
    to negate an expression.

--- Switch case construct is -
    switch(expression){
        case choice1:
            body
            break;
        case choice2:
            body
            break;
        .....
        .....
        default:
            body
    }
