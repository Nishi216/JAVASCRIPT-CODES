--- random(x), returns a whole number between 0 and x-1.

--- Standard for loop -
    -- for (initializer; condition; final-expression) {
    // code to run
    }
    -- If you want to exit a loop before all the iterations have been completed, 
       you can use the break statement. a break statement will immediately exit 
       the loop and make the browser move on to any code that follows it.


--- The continue statement works in a similar manner to break, but instead of breaking 
    out of the loop entirely, it skips to the next iteration of the loop.


--- While loop syntax -
    -- initializer
        while (condition) {
        // code to run

        final-expression
        }

--- Do...While loop syntax -
    -- initializer
    do {
    // code to run

    final-expression
    }
